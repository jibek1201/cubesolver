# cubesolver
## Introduction
This project is a Rubik's Cube solver written in Python. It leverages various algorithms and methods to efficiently solve a scrambled Rubik's Cube. The code is modular, making it easy to understand and extend.

## Files Description
- coord.py: Contains the coordinate representation and related functions for the Rubik's Cube.
- cubie.py: Manages the cubie-level representation of the Rubik's Cube.
- defs.py: Includes various definitions used throughout the project.
- enums.py: Defines the enumerations for moves and other constants.
- moves.py: Implements the moves and their effects on the Rubik's Cube state.
- sockets.py: Handles socket communication for interacting with the solver.
- solver.py: The main solving logic, implementing algorithms to solve the Rubik's Cube.
- start_server.py: Starts the server for interacting with the solver.
- symmetries.py: Manages symmetries to optimize the solving process.
